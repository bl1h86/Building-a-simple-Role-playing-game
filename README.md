# Building-a-simple-Role-playing-game

JavaScript is a powerful scripting language that We can use to make web pages interactive. It's one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS. All modern browsers support JavaScript.

In this practice project, I've learnt fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript by coding my own Role Playing Game. I've learnt how to work with arrays, strings, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more.
